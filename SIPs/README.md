# SPOOL Improvement Proposals


## What is this?

As ascribe's ownership API is exposed to the public, when making changes we
need to be aware of changes that break clients.
Additionally, we only want to introduce changes that expose an interface that
has an appropriate DX (developer experience).
Hence, when making an API change, we discuss the future changes (before
implementing them) in the form of change proposals in this repository.


## How to write a proposal?

1. Create a new document in `/SIPs`
2. Make sure to comply with the current file naming scheme
3. Include the following content:
    - Abstract of the SIP
    - Requirements
    - Description of the problem
    - Proposed Solution
    - Comments on the proposed discussion
4. When in an appropriate state, submit the SIP as a PR


## DO:

    - brief descriptions
    - separation of concerns
    - established facts (give sources if needed)
    - don't over-engineer, writing a proposal shouldn't take you more than 2 hours!
